## Introduction

This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset that combines environmental and financial metrics of companies.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Data Preprocessing

The analysis begins by importing essential libraries and loading the dataset. Missing values are handled by filling them with the mean of other values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Correlation Matrix

The repository showcases a detailed correlation matrix, highlighting relationships between various variables. Noteworthy correlations include those between total assets, dividends, ROA, and ROE.

### Average Pollution by Economic Sector

The repository presents a grouped analysis of average pollution (direct emissions) across different economic sectors.

### Top 10 Companies by Dividend

The analysis identifies and visualizes the top 10 companies with the highest dividends.

## Next Steps

For an in-depth understanding and interactive execution of the analysis, explore the complete code and visualizations in the repository.
